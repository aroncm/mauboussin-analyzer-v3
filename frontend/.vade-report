# Vercel Web Analytics Integration

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics in the React + Vite project as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- **File**: `package.json`
- **Change**: Added `@vercel/analytics@^1.6.1` to dependencies
- This package provides the Analytics component for React applications

### 2. Integrated Analytics component
- **File**: `src/App.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component to the App return statement
  - Wrapped the existing component and Analytics in a React Fragment (`<>...</>`)

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the official Vercel Web Analytics documentation for React/Create React App projects:
- Used the `@vercel/analytics/react` import path (appropriate for plain React/Vite projects)
- Placed the `<Analytics />` component at the app root level in `App.jsx`
- The component will automatically track page views once deployed to Vercel

## Testing Performed

✅ **Dependency Installation**: Successfully installed `@vercel/analytics` package
✅ **Build Verification**: Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ **Linting**: App.jsx has no linting errors (pre-existing errors in other files remain unchanged)
✅ **Lock Files**: package-lock.json updated with new dependency

## Next Steps for the User

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: Deploy the app using `vercel deploy` or connect the Git repository
2. **Enable Analytics**: In the Vercel dashboard, navigate to Project > Analytics tab and click "Enable"
3. **View Data**: After deployment and user visits, analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard
4. **Verify Tracking**: Check browser Network tab for requests to `/_vercel/insights/view` when visiting pages

## Notes

- The Analytics component will only send data when deployed to Vercel (not in local development)
- No route support configuration needed - the component handles it automatically for React applications
- Privacy-compliant analytics that respects user privacy and GDPR requirements
